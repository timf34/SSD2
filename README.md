# SSD2
Re-implementing Eugene's codebase with PettingZoo and SB3 


### Setting up the `venv`

Run: `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment


### General reminders

- Keep the code lean 
  - We should be able to eyeball it! 
- Keep it modular 
  - We should be able to easily add new features
- Test everything 
  - Especially small specific functions (it will help with catching bugs!)
